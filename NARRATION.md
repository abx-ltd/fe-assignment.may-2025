Hi, technical leader,

I'm Linh, a candidate for the test Junior Front-End Engineer Assignmentâ€”May 2025.

I'd a question that :

- At screen 3 , I see it is a new screen independence compared to screens 1 & 2. 

Because , at screens 1 & 2 , I'd build a common layout. So , continue building the screen 3, then I think it is not reasonable. I also update code to review the background screen.

Solution: I think that it should be new repositories that have a new layout. 

Or, if you give me a new solution

Thanks for your watching.


LinhBTN
